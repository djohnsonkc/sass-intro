## These are the steps used in creating this sample project that I documented from his very helpful Youtube video

- In VS Code, install the 'HTML Boilerplate' add on to quickly stub in an HTML page.
- Create a new empty project folder and add a new index.html file to the root. 
- Run 'npm init' to create a package.json file
- Open the index.html file and type 'html' to see how the HTML Boilerplate add on will help create the stubbed in document for you.
