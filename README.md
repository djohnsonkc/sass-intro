## These are the concepts covered in the tutorial

- Nesting
- Imports
- Variables
- Mixins
- Inheritance
  
## These are the steps used in creating this sample project that I documented from his very helpful Youtube video

- Create a new empty project folder and add a new index.html file to the root
- In VS Code, add the 'Live Server' addon for VS Code (this allows you to right-click the index.html page and run it in your browser)
- Install the 'Live Sass Compiler' VS Code add on
- In Terminal, run 'npm init' to create a package.json file
- Create a /styles folder with a styles.ccss (not .css) file and beging writing some CSS
- Click the 'Watch CSS' option in the lower-right corner of VS Code to watch for live changes, which will generate the styles.css file
- Link the styles.css file in your index.html page
- Right-click on index.html and select 'Live Server' to see you changes in real time
